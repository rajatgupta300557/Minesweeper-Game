## Features

- Undo moves with the built-in move stack
- Scroll and fling the board however you wish
- "Safe first click" option
- Inspired by classic Minesweeper; when this option is active you cannot lose before the second move
- High level of configurability (custom board sizes and mine counts)
 
## Controls

- Tap a field to reveal it (and potentially lose)
- Long press on a field to flag it
- Flagged fields cannot be revealed by accident until they are un-flagged
- Double-tap on a revealed field to reveal all adjacent fields

If you reveal a mine, you lose.

When all safe fields are revealed, you win!
